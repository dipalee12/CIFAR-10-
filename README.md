# CIFAR-10

# Image classification with CNN architecture
In this nothbook, an attempt was made to build an  image classifer with classic vanilla CNN architectue on standard CIFAR-10 dataset. Tensorflow and keras libraries were used to construct the model and traied model with a kaggle gpu for rapid training.
